# Research Questions:

## While working on this project, I specifically oriented my work, around the following questions keeping two electoral candidates in mind (Mr. Donald J. Trump & Mr. Joe Biden):

1. Is there a marginal difference in the ‘Twitter-holdings’ (user base) of both the candidates? (answered by: general Twitter analysis in sub-topic 1.2)
2. What ‘Sentiments’ are the candidates trying to drive from their daily tweets? (answered by: sentiment analysis of tweets using SparkNLP in sub-topic 2.2)
3. How are ‘User Behaving’ (by studying the user level tweet sentiments) on a day to day level towards these candidates? (answered by: sentiment analysis of tweets using SparkNLP in sub-topic 2.2)
4. What are the ‘Most Discussed Topics’ (top 3) by these candidates over Twitter? (answered by: LDA topic-modeling using SparkNLP in sub-topic 2.3)
5. Is there a way through which I could ‘Automate’ my analysis over a daily frequency? (answered by: local deployment of Models using windows cmd & connecting data to live open-source RDBMS PostgreSQL in sub-topic 3)
